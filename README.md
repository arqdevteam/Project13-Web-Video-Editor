**WAVE**(Web Application for Video Editing) is a client-based web video🎥Editor , browser without the need to install a separate program🌍It is possible to work only. The video editing process is performed by the client rather than the server, so the server load does not occur much.

Users can load video locally or from the server, add various effects through the UI, and download and upload the result to the server . This is done by playing the original video in the HTML5 <video> element, extracting frames, applying editing effects to each extracted frame, and combining them to create an mp4 file.

When a video is taken with a mobile phone and turned 90°, or when you want to cut out unnecessary parts from the front and back, you can start WAVE by turning on the Chrome browser without the hassle of downloading and running a video editing program !**
